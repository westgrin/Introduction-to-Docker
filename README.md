# Mini Project - Introduction to Docker

## Project Overview
This project introduces Docker, a containerization platform, covering its installation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, running a "Hello World" container, and practicing basic Docker commands, executed on Ubuntu (WSL) with VS Code.

## Setup
- Initiated on Jul 04, 2025, 12:39 PM WAT.
- Used Ubuntu terminal (WSL) with VS Code, documented in /mnt/c/Users/User/Documents/Workspace/Shell_AWS_Mini_Project.

## Execution Steps
1. **Install Docker**:
   - Set up repository, installed `docker-ce`, and configured user permissions.
   
2. **Run "Hello World" Container**:
   - Executed `docker run hello-world` to verify setup and understand the lifecycle.
   
3. **Practice Basic Commands**:
   - Used `run`, `ps`, `stop`, `pull`, `push`, `images`, and `rmi` with Nginx and Ubuntu images.
   
## Learning Summary
This project introduced me to Docker, a transformative containerization tool that resolves the "it works on my machine" issue by encapsulating applications with their dependencies. I learned that containers, unlike resource-heavy virtual machines, share the host OS kernel, offering portability, efficiency, and rapid scaling across development, testing, and production environments. Installing Docker on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, running the "Hello World" container, and mastering commands like `docker run`, `ps`, and `pull` provided hands-on experience with the image and container lifecycle. This foundational knowledge highlights Dockerâ€™s role in streamlining deployment and enhancing resource utilization, preparing me for advanced container orchestration and modern DevOps practices.

## Tools Used
- **Ubuntu Terminal (WSL)**: For Docker installation and command execution.
- **VS Code**: For editing `README.md`.
- **Git Bash**: For version control and GitHub push.
- **AWS EC2 (Optional)**: For hosting the Ubuntu instance.

## Project Deliverables
- **Documentation**: This `README.md` with steps and learning summary.
